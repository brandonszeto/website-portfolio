### Introduction

The artifical intelligence scene is extremely fast-paced. New papers are being
published every day, making it hard for even experts to keep up with everything.
As a beginner, it is hard to know where to even start.

As a result, this blog aims to simplify the learning process by providing a
curated list of learning resources on the fundamentals of machine learning and
artificial intelligence. These resources span papers, blog posts, courses, and
talks that have had a significant impact in the field. 

### Motivation
Before diving in, let's understand the motivation behind machine learning and
artificial intelligence. 
The following resources help explain the importance of what Andrej Karpathy
describes as "Software 2.0", without demanding any previous mathematical
knowledge.

- [Software 2.0](https://karpathy.medium.com/software-2-0-a64152b37c35): In his
  medium blog,
  Andrej Karpathy argues how abstract neural networks have become a powerful new
  way to program computers (More of Andrej's content can be found on 
  [Medium](https://karpathy.medium.com) and
  [ X](https://twitter.com/karpathy)).
