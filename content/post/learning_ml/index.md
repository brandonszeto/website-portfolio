### Introduction

The artifical intelligence scene is extremely fast-paced. New papers are being
published every day, making it hard for even experts to keep up with everything.
As a beginner, it is hard to know where to even start.

As a result, this blog aims to simplify the learning process by providing a
curated list of learning resources on the fundamentals of machine learning and
artificial intelligence. These resources span papers, blog posts, courses, and
talks that I feel have helped me significantly in understanding complex topics.

### Motivation
Before diving in, let's understand the motivation behind machine learning and
artificial intelligence. 
The following resources help explain the importance of what Andrej Karpathy
describes as "Software 2.0", without demanding any previous mathematical
knowledge.

- [Software 2.0](https://karpathy.medium.com/software-2-0-a64152b37c35): In his
  medium blog,
  Andrej Karpathy argues how abstract neural networks have become a powerful new
  way to program computers (More of Andrej's content can be found on 
  [Medium](https://karpathy.medium.com) and
  [ X](https://twitter.com/karpathy)).

Additionally, many machine learning resources can be found on
platforms including:
- [arXiv](https://arxiv.org): a preprint repository that allows researchers to
  share findings before they undergo peer review (speeds up the dissemination of
  bleeding-edge scientific knowledge from researchers at established
  companies and universities).
- [GitHub](github.com): a repository hosting service that is home to many
  learning resources related to machine learning, data science, and artificial
  intelligence. Resources range from interactive notebooks to textbooks. Some
  notable repositories include:
    - [Awesome Machine Learning](https://github.com/josephmisiti/awesome-machine-learning)
    - [Awesome Deep Learning](https://github.com/ChristosChristofidis/awesome-deep-learning)
    - [Python Data Science Handbook](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook)
    - [Deep Learning Papers Reading Roadmap](https://github.com/floodsung/Deep-Learning-Papers-Reading-Roadmap)
    - [fast.ai](https://github.com/fastai/fastai)

  Of course, the source code of open-source machine learning and artificial
      intelligence tools like TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, etc. all live on
      GitHub.
- [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co): a repository hosting service focused
  on democratizing and advancing artificial intelligence by enabling the
  open-source machine learning community with a platform to share models and
  datasets.
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com): a platform for predictive modeling and
  analytics competitions. The platform provides datasets and notebooks where
  users can write, run, and share Python and R code and is a great place to get
  started with building models and exploring datasets.
- Social media sites like[ X](x.com) and [Reddit](reddit.com) have active
  thriving communities surrounding topics like machine learning, data science,
  and can be a great place to get involved and have a presence in the community.

This is alot. Thus, before getting lost in the many resources that exist online,
I believe it is important to nail the basics (i.e. definitions and
big-picture ideas) that are fundamental to understanding machine learning and
artifical intelligence.

### The Basics
- [AI Glossary by a16z](https://a16z.com/ai-glossary/): Definitions of some
  abbreviations and terms that you may come across when reading.
- [Deep Learning in a Nutshell: Core Concepts](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/deep-learning-nutshell-core-concepts/): 
  A four-part series from NVIDIA that walks through more definitions found 
  in deep learning in a glossary style.
