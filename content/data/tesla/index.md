> Data Sources
> - [Tesla Fleet API](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/getting-started/what-is-fleet-api) is a data and command service exposing Tesla vehicles and energy devices to customers.
> - [Tesla Fleet Telemetry](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/fleet-telemetry) allows your server to listen to data streams from specified vehicles, eliminating the need to routinely poll an Tesla's API endpoint. This is critical to prevent unnecessary vehicle wakes and battery drain while recieving live data points.
> - [Tesla Insurance Safety Score (Beta)](https://www.tesla.com/support/insurance/safety-score) provides a report of a safety score along with the number of miles driven with FSD.
