Below is a collection of leetcode problems that I did on video to help me
practice technical interview questions. I find that being on video is a great
form of rubber ducking; I can practice explaining my thoughts while under
pressure.

The following closely follows the structure articulated by [NeetCode](https://neetcode.io).
I also took notes on how I felt about each problem/performance.
