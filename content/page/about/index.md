### Education
I am a third-year undergraduate student at [UCSD](ucsd.edu) majoring in
computer engineering 
[(EC26)](https://ece.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/undergraduate-programs/computer-engineering-major).
I am currently pursuing the 
[ECE BS/MS Graduate Program](https://ece.ucsd.edu/faculty-research/ece-research-areas/machine-learning-data-science-impacted),
specializing in Machine Learning and Data Science.

### New skills/tools I'm playing with
- Learning machine learning using a top-down approach (i.e. start with a framework
  like PyTorch and work my way down to understanding basic tensor operations and
  functions like autograd).
- Unity Game Development (playing with ML Agents in simulation)
- GPU architecture and programming to better understand how applications from 
  games to neural networks can be accelerated.
- Embedded programming with a Raspberry Pi 3 + camera module (applications
  include real-time object detection, a DNS server to block ads, and pushing its
  limited compute by running inference)
