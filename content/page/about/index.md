## About Me 👋

### Education
I am a third-year undergraduate student at [UCSD](ucsd.edu) majoring in
computer engineering 
[(EC26)](https://ece.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/undergraduate-programs/computer-engineering-major).
I am currently pursuing the 
[ECE BS/MS Graduate Program](https://ece.ucsd.edu/faculty-research/ece-research-areas/machine-learning-data-science-impacted),
specializing in Machine Learning and Data Science.

I expect to complete this continguous BS/MS program in 3 years (undergraduate) +
1 year (graduate) = 4 total years.

### Interests
Currently:
- 📖 Reading [An Introduction to Statistical Learning (Python)](https://www.statlearning.com)
- 🕹️ Playing with Unity game development (with the intention of running
  simulations)

Want to:
- Familiarize myself with machine learning frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Keras
- Test the computational limits of running inference models on my 
  Raspberry Pi
- Familiarize myself with GPU programming to better understand how ML
  applications are hardware-accelerated

### Activities
- 👨‍💻 Currently serving as [ECE USC](https://eceusc.ucsd.edu)'s professional chair.
