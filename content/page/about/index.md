Graduate student at **[UCSD](ucsd.edu)** (coursework [here](https://brandonszeto.com/coursework/)); currently studying **[intelligent
systems, robotics & controls](https://www.ece.ucsd.edu/faculty-research/ece-research-areas/intelligent-systems-robotics-control-impacted)**. I'm broadly interested in autonomy, controls, reinforcement learning, distributed/embedded systems, and machine learning.

Some of my current and past work include:
- **[UCSD Existential Robotics Lab](http://erl.ucsd.edu)**: Graduate research
assistant implementing deep reinforcement learning on drones and robotic limbs.
- **[Intel Corporation](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html)**: Data science intern automating plant supply chain processes supporting Intel Raptor Lake. 
- **[Esri](https://www.esri.com/en-us/home)**: Software development engineer intern integrating semantic/vector search into hosted feature services on ArcGIS Enterprise.
- **[UCSD](http://erl.ucsd.edu)**: B.S. in Computer Engineering with a focus on introductory machine learning and data engineering.
- **[AMI-USC](https://research.usc.edu/news/2021/09/alfred-e-mann-institute-for-biomedical-engineering/)**: Worked on applications of soft robotics and augmented reality in healthcare and medicine.

Outside of engineering, I enjoy geography, history, photography, and classical music.
